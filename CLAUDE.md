Please, update it each time you update a project with information you might need.

##Project description

This project is a PoC of educational web-platform I want to create.
The core idea is to make a system where any person can create own educational trajectory, track progress and make knowledge portfolio.
It will work around knowledge graph, that will connect topics from different domains by prerequisite-effect connection.
In this model student learning goals, educators courses and employers vacancies are just a set of topics.
So students set goals and collect knowledge, educators provide courses on these topics and validate results and employers can find workers with
the right set of skills, seeing all the knowledge picture.

## General coding rules

Please, keep it divided into small independent modules.
Add short description comment to each non-obvious method and to each file.

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Development (IMPORTANT: Use environment-specific commands)
npm run dev:sqlite    # Start development server with SQLite (LOCAL)
npm run dev:postgres  # Start development server with PostgreSQL (PRODUCTION)

# Database Management
npx prisma studio     # Open database GUI
npm run db:switch:sqlite   # Switch to SQLite schema + regenerate client
npm run db:switch:postgres # Switch to PostgreSQL schema + regenerate client
npx prisma migrate dev --name [name]  # Create database migration  
npx prisma generate   # Generate Prisma client after schema changes
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Never commit `prisma/schema.prisma` when it contains SQLite configuration! 
Always ensure PostgreSQL schema is active before committing to avoid production database issues.

## Database Configuration

### Dual Database Setup
- **Local Development**: SQLite (`./dev.db`) - Use `npm run dev:sqlite`
- **Production**: PostgreSQL (Railway) - Use `npm run dev:postgres`
- **Schema Switching**: Automatic via npm scripts that copy appropriate schema files

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Local Development (.env.local)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
DATABASE_PROVIDER="sqlite"

# Production (Railway environment)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DATABASE_PROVIDER="postgresql"
```

### Database Operations
- Admin promotion: First user can promote themselves via `/api/admin/promote`
- All entities implemented: User, Topic, Goal, Course, Vacancy with proper relationships
- **Schema Files**: 
  - `prisma/schema.sqlite.prisma` - SQLite version (local dev)
  - `prisma/schema.postgres.prisma` - PostgreSQL version (production)
  - `prisma/schema.prisma` - Active schema (auto-generated by npm scripts)

### OAuth Fix
**IMPORTANT**: Always use `npm run dev:sqlite` for local development to ensure proper database configuration for OAuth authentication.

## Authentication Flow

1. User signs in via Google OAuth2
2. NextAuth.js creates user record in database 
3. First user can promote themselves to ADMIN via "Become Admin" button
4. Role-based access controls API endpoints and UI navigation
5. JWT tokens include user role for authorization

## Key Files to Understand

- `src/app/api/topics/route.ts` - Topic CRUD API with validation and prerequisites
- `src/app/admin/topics/` - Admin panel for topic management 
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration with Google provider
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete database schema with all relationships
- `src/lib/auth/middleware.ts` - API authentication middleware for protected routes

- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error handling

## UI/UX Design Decisions

### Topic Display Standards
**Decision**: Use pictograms for topic types and background colors for learning statuses.

**Implementation**:
- **Pictograms for Topic Types** (always visible):
  - 📚 Theory topics
  - ⚙️ Practice topics  
  - 🚀 Project topics
- **Background Colors for Learning Status** (when user is authenticated):
  - Gray: NOT_LEARNED
  - Blue: WANT_TO_LEARN
  - Yellow: LEARNING
  - Green: LEARNED
  - Purple: LEARNED_AND_VALIDATED

**Rationale**: This approach separates semantic meaning (what type of topic) from progress tracking (learning status), making the interface more intuitive and avoiding visual conflicts between different information types.

**Applied to**: All student-facing pages including /vacancies, /courses, /goals, and dashboard views.

### Goal Architecture
**Decision**: Separate Goal Templates (public, reusable) from Student Goals (private, personal).

**Problem Solved**: The original "public goals" concept didn't make sense - students shouldn't create public goals, and sharing personal learning objectives isn't useful for other learners.

**New Architecture**:
- **GoalTemplate** - Created by platform team/educators, public, reusable templates
- **Goal** - Always private, owned by students, can be created from templates or from scratch
- **Relationship**: Goals can optionally reference the GoalTemplate they were created from

**Database Changes**:
- Added `GoalTemplate` model with `GoalTemplateTopic` junction table
- Removed `isPublic` field from `Goal` model
- Added optional `goalTemplateId` field to `Goal` model

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/goal-templates` - Public browsing of templates
- `/api/admin/goal-templates` - Admin management of templates
- `/api/goals` - Private student goal management (no public browsing)

**UI Changes**:
- `/goals` page now shows goal templates instead of public goals
- Admin panel manages goal templates at `/admin/goal-templates`
- Student goal creation removes visibility toggles (always private)

**Rationale**: This creates a cleaner separation between curated content (templates) and personal learning objectives (goals), making the platform more logical and useful.

## Recent Improvements & Features

### Course Filtering Enhancement
- **Problem**: Topic type dropdown was impractical for large databases
- **Solution**: Replaced dropdown with text search field for topic names
- **Benefit**: Scalable filtering that works with unlimited topics

### Knowledge Graph Navigation Enhancement (Latest)
- **Local Graph Views**: Added focused topic exploration with `/knowledge-graph/local/[topicSlug]`
- **Smart Back Navigation**: Consistent referrer tracking across topic changes with sessionStorage persistence
- **Double-Click Navigation**: Intuitive transition from global graph nodes to local focused views
- **Clean UI**: Removed redundant canvas buttons, moved essential controls to headers
- **Platform Integration**: Topic badges throughout site (courses, goals, vacancies, dashboard) link to local graph
- **API Endpoints**: New `/api/topics/local-graph/[topicId]` for topic relationships and expansion
- **Suspense Compliance**: Proper Next.js 15 static generation support with loading boundaries
- **Components**: `LocalKnowledgeGraph.tsx` with D3.js tree layout and expansion controls

### Knowledge Graph Integration  
- **Enhancement**: Added course discovery to right panel
- **Feature**: When selecting a topic, shows all courses that cover that topic
- **Navigation**: Direct links to course detail pages
- **UX**: Seamless integration between graph exploration and practical learning paths

### Role-Based Vacancy Features
- **Smart Filtering**: "Create Learning Goal" button only appears for users in Student role
- **Context Awareness**: Employers and Educators see clean vacancy interface without student-specific actions
- **Simplified Interface**: Removed unnecessary "skill type" filters (most vacancies include mixed topic types)

### UI Polish
- **Consistent Navigation**: Back buttons on all sub-pages following standard patterns
- **Filter Simplification**: Removed meaningless filters (e.g., topic types for vacancies)
- **Error Handling**: Improved null-safe rendering across all components
- **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators for all async operations

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Google OAuth2 credentials (for authentication)
- Domain name (for production URLs)

### Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` with:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
```

### Build & Deploy Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Knowledge Graph Navigation Patterns

### Important Implementation Notes:
- **Referrer Tracking**: All navigation to local graph (`/knowledge-graph/local/[topicSlug]`) should pass `?from=` parameter
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Components using `useSearchParams()` must be wrapped in `<Suspense>` for Next.js 15 compatibility
- **sessionStorage**: Original referrer is stored in `localGraphOriginalReferrer` key for consistency across topic changes
- **Double-Click**: Global graph nodes support double-click to navigate to focused local view

### Navigation Flow:
1. User clicks topic badge anywhere on platform → Local graph with referrer
2. User explores prerequisites/effects in local graph → Maintains original referrer
3. User clicks back button → Returns to original source (not intermediate topics)
4. User double-clicks global graph node → Focused local view with current page as referrer

### Key Files:
- `src/app/knowledge-graph/page.tsx` - Global graph with Suspense wrapper
- `src/app/knowledge-graph/local/[topicSlug]/page.tsx` - Local graph with referrer management
- `src/components/LocalKnowledgeGraph.tsx` - D3.js focused topic visualization
- `src/app/api/topics/local-graph/[topicId]/route.ts` - Topic relationship API

### Database Setup for Production
1. **SQLite**: Works out-of-box, suitable for small-medium scale
2. **PostgreSQL**: For larger scale, update `DATABASE_URL` in schema.prisma
3. **Seed Data**: Run `node seed-script.js` to populate initial topics/courses

### Deployment Platforms
- **Vercel**: Recommended (built by Next.js team)
- **Railway**: Good alternative with database hosting
- **DigitalOcean**: For custom server setup
- **AWS/Google Cloud**: Enterprise-grade options

### First-Time Setup
1. Deploy application
2. Visit `/api/auth/signin` to create first user
3. First user can promote themselves to ADMIN
4. Use admin panel to create initial topics, courses, and goal templates
5. Invite educators and employers to join
