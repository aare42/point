# Knowledge Graph Implementation Versions

## GridBasedOptimized-v1 (Current - Saved)

**File**: `src/components/KnowledgeGraph-GridBasedOptimized-v1.tsx`  
**Date**: 2025-01-23

### ✅ **Features Implemented:**

1. **Level-Based Grid Layout**
   - Topics positioned by prerequisite depth (level 0 = no prerequisites)
   - Fixed grid structure prevents overlaps
   - Centered layout with proper spacing

2. **Edge Length Optimization**
   - Grid-based positioning minimizes edge lengths within constraints
   - Topics positioned near their prerequisites when possible
   - Conflict resolution for optimal grid assignment

3. **Enhanced Arrows**
   - Sharp arrow tips positioned at line ends (not 80% back)
   - Smooth convex curves with vertical movement near endpoints
   - Precise edge-to-edge connections (no floating)

4. **Visual Improvements**
   - Doubled vertical spacing (200px between levels)
   - Clean grid structure with no intersections
   - Professional curved arrow paths

### **Technical Specs:**
- **Grid Cell**: 220px width × 200px height
- **Arrow Style**: Cubic Bezier curves with 40% vertical offset
- **Level Calculation**: Recursive prerequisite depth analysis
- **Positioning**: Grid-based with edge length optimization

### **Use Case:**
Perfect for displaying clear prerequisite hierarchies with professional curved arrows and optimal edge lengths within a structured grid layout.
